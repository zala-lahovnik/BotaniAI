# BotaniAI: Installation and Setup Guide

Welcome to BotaniAI, an innovative project that brings together plant enthusiasts and technology. Follow the steps below to install and run the project seamlessly.

## Frontend Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine and open it in your favorite IDE.

2. **Firebase Project Setup:**
    - Create a new project in the Firebase Console. Need help? Check out the [Firebase Console Project creation guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup).
    - Open the Apps section of your project in Firebase Console, locate the Web App, and open it to find the Firebase Config data.

3. **Firebase Function Setup:**
    - To run the classification model, you'll need to host your own Firebase Function. Follow the official [Firebase Functions tutorial](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/get-started?gen=2nd) to set up Firebase Functions. Note: Overwrite the existing files as Firebase Functions are already initialized.
    - Add the location of your hosted Python Firebase Function by appending a line to the `firebase-config.js` file.

4. **Expo Google Login Setup:**
    - To enable Google login on Expo, you need Expo Google login keys. Create these keys by following the [Expo Google Authentication tutorial](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/google-authentication/).

5. Create a new JavaScript file named `firebase-config.js` inside the `Frontend/firebase` folder. Use the Firebase Config data, Firebase Function location, and Expo Google login keys to populate the file. The structure should resemble the example below:
```js
export const API_KEY="API_KEY_VALUE"
export const AUTH_DOMAIN="AUTH_DOMAIN_VALUE"
export const PROJECT_ID="PROJECT_ID_VALUE"
export const STORAGE_BUCKET="STORAGE_BUCKET_VALUE"
export const MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="MESSAGING_SENDER_ID_VALUE"
export const APP_ID="APP_ID_VALUE"
export const FUNCTIONS_REGION="FUNCTIONS_REGION_VALUE"
export const GOOGLE_ANDROID="GOOGLE_ANDROID_VALUE"
export const GOOGLE_IOS="GOOGLE_IOS_VALUE"
export const GOOGLE_EXPO="GOOGLE_EXPO_VALUE"
```

6. If you decide not to use Firebase Functions, don't worry! Simply comment out the relevant code sections. But keep in mind, some of the app's key features might be missed along the way.

7. In the ```Frontend\api``` folder, locate the ```backend.ts``` file. Let it know the location of your backend server by adding this captivating line:
```ts
export const BACKEND_BASE_URI = 'BACKEND_BASE_URI_VALUE'
```
Replace ```BACKEND_BASE_URI_VALUE``` with the actual URI of your backend server, and let the frontend and backend dance together harmoniously.

8. Install the project dependencies by running the following command inside the `Frontend` directory:
```
npm i
```

9. Start the application using the following command:
```
npx expo start
```
10. You can now view the mobile app in ExpoGo by scanning the QR code! 📱🔍

## Backend Setup

Follow these steps to seamlessly set up the backend of the project:

1. **MongoDB Setup:**
   - Begin by creating a MongoDB database to store backend data.
   - Make sure to copy the database connection link for later use.

2. **Firebase Storage Bucket Info:**
   - Retrieve the Storage bucket info from your frontend's `firebase-config.js` file.
   - Copy the required information from the file and paste it here.

3. **Firebase Database URL Info:**
   - Obtain the Database URL info from your Firebase console, just like you did for the mobile app setup.
   - Need a refresher? Follow this [tutorial](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup) to find the Database URL.

4. **Firebase Service Account Info:**
   - Obtain your Firebase service account info following the instructions in this [tutorial](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup#initialize_the_sdk_in_non-google_environments).

5. **Firebase Service Account File:**
   - Save the downloaded `firebase_service_account.json` file into the Backend folder.

6. **jwtToken Secret:**
   - Unleash your creativity and generate a unique token secret that will safeguard the power of authentication. Or, if you prefer, let your imagination run wild and come up with a secret that truly reflects your project. Embrace the excitement of secrecy and add it to the .env file to fortify your application's security. Keep the key to the kingdom in your hands! 🔑

7. **Environment Configuration:**
   - Create an `.env` file inside the `Backend` directory.
   - Paste the MongoDB connection link, Storage bucket info, Firebase database URL and the name of the `firebase_service_account.json` file, as shown below:
```
DATABASE_URI=mongodb://username:password@localhost:27017/database_name
FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL=YOUR_DATABASE_URL
STORAGE_BUCKET=STORAGE_BUCKET_VALUE
SERVICE_ACCOUNT=firebase_service_account.json
TOKEN_SECRET=YOUR_TOKEN_SECRET_VALUE
```

7. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Install the project dependencies by running the following command inside the `Backend` directory:
```
npm i
```

8. **Start the Backend Server:**
   - Launch the backend server by running the following command in the `Backend` folder:
```
node server.js
```

9. Get ready to unleash the full potential of the project by powering up the backend! 🚀✨
